# Spark Analysis Application

This project is designed to analyze data from the Spark History Server via its API and generate recommendations regarding data skew, executor memory usage, and other performance metrics.

```

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd spark-analysis-app
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure the application settings in `src/config/settings.py` to include your Spark History Server API endpoint and authentication details.

## Usage

To run the application, execute the following command:
```
python src/app.py
```

## Functionality

- The application connects to the Spark History Server API to fetch job data.
- It analyzes the data to identify potential issues such as data skew and inefficient executor memory usage.
- Recommendations are generated based on the analysis to help optimize Spark job performance.
